第一次看到PWA是冦云在群里分享了一个Twitter升级PWA的消息；
第二次看是InfoQ的订阅。

Google了一下，发现这是一个[Google提升Web端用户体验的解决方案](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)。自己陌生的技术了解一下总是好的，扩充自己的技术解决方案堆栈。

## PWA是什么

> Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:
> 
> 1. Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
> 2. Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
> 3. Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
>
> This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.
