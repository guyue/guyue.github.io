[原文](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/more-resources.html)

If you just read through this website, you should be able to build a pretty cool React Native app. But React Native isn't just a product made by one company - it's a community of thousands of developers. So if you're interested in React Native, here's some related stuff you might want to check out.

通读了本站点的资料，可以构建一个漂亮的React Native应用程序。但React Native不只是由某家公司创造出来的——这里有一个数以千计开发人员组成的社区。如果你对React Native感兴趣，下列是你可能感兴趣的一些相关资源。

## 流行库（Popular Libraries）

If you're using React Native, you probably already know about [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). So I feel a bit silly mentioning this. But if you haven't, check out React - it's the best way to build a modern website.

如果正在使用React Native，你可能已经知道了[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)；如果还不知道，可以了解一下React——当前创建现代网站最好的方式。

One common question is how to handle the "state" of your React Native application. The most popular library for this is [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). Don't be afraid of how often Redux uses the word "reducer" - it's a pretty simple library, and there's also a nice [series of videos](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) explaining it.

另一个棘手的问题是处理React Native应用程序中的状态。这方面最流行的库是[Redux](http://redux.js.org/)。不要被Redux中的“Reducer“这个单词吓到——这真的是一个简单的库，可以从这[系列视频](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)查看详细解释。

If you're looking for a library that does a specific thing, check out [Awesome React Native](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/), a curated list of components that also has demos, articles, and other stuff.

如果需要寻找一个特定的功能的库，可以查阅[Awesome React Native](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/)，这是一份组件相关的完整清单，也包含示例、文章和其他的资源。

## 应用程序示例（Example Apps）

There are some [example apps on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactNativeNews/React-Native-Apps). You can run the apps on a simulator or device, and you can see the source code for these apps, which is neat.

[Github上有一些应用程序示例](https://github.com/ReactNativeNews/React-Native-Apps)，可以在模拟器器或者手机上运行，也可以直接查看这些应用程序的源代码。

The folks who built the app for Facebook's F8 conference in 2016 also [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app) and wrote up a [detailed series of tutorials](http://makeitopen.com/tutorials/building-the-f8-app/planning/). This is useful if you want a more in-depth example that's more realistic than most sample apps out there.

为2016年Facebook的F8大会创建的应用程序已经[开源了代码](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app)，并为此创建了一份[完整的教程](http://makeitopen.com/tutorials/building-the-f8-app/planning/)。这份代码的质量相对较高，非常有参考价值。

## 开发工具（Development Tools）

[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) is the IDE that Facebook uses internally for React Native development. The killer feature of Nuclide is its debugging ability. It also has great inline Flow support.

[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/)是Facebook内部进行React Native开发的IDE。最大的特色是调试能力，并且内置了强大的Flow支持。

[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) is a starter kit that uses Redux and a few different common UI libraries. It has a CLI to generate apps, components, and containers. If you like all of the individual tech choices, Ignite could be perfect for you.

[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)是一个集成了Redux和一些常见的UI库的工具包。提供了一个CLI来创建应用程序，组件和容器。如果你认可所有的技术选择，Ignite是一个很好的选择。

[CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) is a service from Microsoft that makes it easy to deploy live updates to your React Native app. If you don't like going through the app store process to deploy little tweaks, and you also don't like setting up your own backend, give CodePush a try.

[CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/)是Microsoft创建的服务，为React Native应用程序提供在线更新功能。如果不想总是通过应用商店来发布应用程序，也不想自建后台服务，可以试试CodePush。

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io) is a development environment plus application that focuses on letting you build React Native apps in the Expo development environment, without ever touching Xcode or Android Studio. If you wish React Native was even more JavaScripty and webby, check out Expo.

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io)是一个开发环境和应用程序的集合，帮助开发者专注于在Expo开发环境进行React Native应用程序的开发，避免接触Xcode或者Android Studio。如果你愿意React Native更接近JavaScript化，并且能力更强大，可以试试Expo。

## 在哪儿可以找到React Native的开发者（Where React Native People Hang Out）

The [React Native Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/react.native.community) Facebook group has thousands of developers, and it's pretty active. Come there to show off your project, or ask how other people solved similar problems.

[React Native Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/react.native.community) Facebook小组有数以千计的开发者，这里有着积极的讨论。可以在这里炫耀你的项目，或者咨询大家是否遇到过相似的问题。

[Reactiflux](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZjGY5n) is a Discord chat where a lot of React-related discussion happens, including React Native. Discord is just like Slack except it works better for open source projects with a zillion contributors. Check out the #react-native channel.

[Reactiflux](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZjGY5n)是一个React相关的论坛，包含React Native相关的内容。Discord跟Slack更像，更适合针对开源项目的讨论，签出#react-native频道。

The [React Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reactjs) covers both React and React Native. Follow the React Native [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reactnative) and [blog](/react-native/blog/) to find out what's happening in the world of React Native.

[React Twitter账户](https://twitter.com/reactjs)涵盖了React和React Native的信息。关注该[Twitter帐号](https://twitter.com/reactnative)和[博客](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/)，来关注React Native相关的信息。

There are a lot of [React Native Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/topics/react-native/) that happen around the world. Often there is React Native content in React meetups as well.

可以关注[React Native Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/topics/react-native/)来查找世界范围内的会议。React相关的会议中通常也包含React Native的内容。

Sometimes we have React conferences. We posted the [videos from React.js Conf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS3fZ46IGFirdqKTIxlws7e0) and [React.js Conf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY), and we'll probably have more conferences in the future, too. Stay tuned. You can also find a list of dedicated React Native conferences [here](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/#conferences).

有一些官方的React会议，通常会将[React.js Conf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS3fZ46IGFirdqKTIxlws7e0)和[React.js Conf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY)的视频上传，以后可能还会组织更多的会议，可以在[这里](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/#conferences)查看React Native会议的清单。
